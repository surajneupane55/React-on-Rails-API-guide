Building a complete application with API is always a challenging job since every element must connect and work as intended. This guide will take you through the experience I encountered during building a simple React on Rails API. 

We will first build a small RESTful JSON Rails api that serves data which later will be consumed by our React Application.


### Building Rails application to consume data from React  

Rails 5 have evolved a lot where we can now have an option to creat api only. This option removes all the Middleware which are not necessary unlike native rails application. For example: Views are never created when we choose to create api application.

Our application will have resource name Record with following attributes: name, email and phone.

```markdown
Create Rails application

`$ rails new my_api --api`


Create Resource for Record 

`$ rails g resource Record name:string email:string phone:integer`

Migration to database

`$ rails db:create`
`$ rails db:migrate`

```

Next we want to set our routes in ```config/routes``` 


``` 

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :records
end

```

If you notice above we don't define any root_path and that makes sense when we want to make our api stand-alone, stateless or sessionless which is holy grail of api functionality.

The other thing we are interested is to serialize our Record model. We want to make our json more readable, understandable and uniform which is taken care by

``` gem 'active_model_serializers', '~> 0.10.0' ```

. There is a great [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/active_model_serializers) which can be followed to get more information.



















You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/surajneupane55/React-on-Rails-API-guide/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/surajneupane55/React-on-Rails-API-guide/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
